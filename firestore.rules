/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the EGX Portfolio Tracker app.
 * All user-specific data, including profiles, investments, and monthly summaries, is isolated within
 * a user-specific path, ensuring users can only access their own information. A separate global
 * collection provides public, read-only access to asset price data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: A user's private profile document.
 * - /users/{userId}/investments/{investmentId}: A subcollection containing the user's private investment records.
 * - /users/{userId}/monthlySummaries/{monthlySummaryId}: A subcollection for the user's private AI-generated summaries.
 * - /assetPrices/{assetPriceId}: A top-level collection for public asset price data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Default Deny: All paths are closed by default. Access is granted only through explicit rules.
 * - Strict Ownership: Users have full control over documents within their own data tree (/users/{userId}/**),
 *   but are completely denied access to other users' data.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing the top-level `/users` collection is forbidden to protect user privacy.
 * - Public Data Segregation: Publicly readable data (`assetPrices`) is stored in a separate top-level
 *   collection. Writes to this collection are disabled from the client to ensure data integrity, assuming
 *   it will be managed by a trusted backend service.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The rules rely on path-based authorization (`/users/{userId}`).
 *   For data integrity, documents within this path (like Investments) must contain a `userId` field
 *   that matches the path, and this field is immutable after creation.
